Africa: a majority of countries have a linear relationship between CO2 emission per person and GDP per capita.
Americas: overall a linear relationship between CO2 emission per person and GDP per capita for countries with a smaller population but countires with larger populations the emissions per person doesn't increase much as GDP for capita increases.
Asia: for many countries with low populations there doesn't to be a relation between emission and GDP. In countries with larger populations emissions do not increase as severely as other continents' when GDP increases.
Europe: around half of the countries' emissions do not increase with GDP, and the rest's emissions increase steadily with GDP.
Oceania: emissions increase steadily with GDP.
